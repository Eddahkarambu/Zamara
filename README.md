# Context And Goal

#### I was able to do the following:

- ##### With the help of DummyJson free API (https://dummyjson.com/docs/auth), I was able to implement an interface where a random user from the users list (https://dummyjson.com/users) can login and logout using a username and a password.
- ##### Create a dashboard that welcomes a logged in user. The Dashboard has a title which is the users first and lastname and a body which contains users details.
- ##### With the help of CrudCrud free API (https://crudcrud.com/), I created an interfaces that will be used to Create, Read, Update and Delete a list of Zamara Staff
- ##### With the help of SMTP Bucket (https://www.smtpbucket.com/), whenever a staff profile is created, updated, or deleted; they should be able to receive a personalized email notification
